# SCS training materials

## About
This training material has been created by [dNation](https://dnation.cloud/)
for [S7n Cloud Services GmbH](https://garloff.de/s7n/) who has been commissioned by the
[ITU](https://itu.int/) for the creation of advanced
[SCS](https://scs.community/) training material.
The SCS trainings are part of the engagement with the
[govstack project](https://govstack.global/), which has defined
a [cloud building block specification](https://govstack.gitbook.io/bb-cloud-infrastructure)
and [lists SCS as compliant offering](https://www.govstack.global/software/).

The copyright of the training material belongs to the ITU, but it has been agreed
that the material will be made available under an Open Source License, so it can
be used broadly and collaboratively improved.

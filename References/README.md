## Digital Sovereignty

* Sovereignty is the ability to decisions about your fate yourself and be very
  deliberate which dependencies with what risks you are willing to accept.
* Digital platforms tend to come with strong dependencies.
* SCS has
  [published](https://the-report.cloud/why-digital-sovereignty-is-more-than-mere-legal-compliance/)
  a four-level taxonomy for digital sovereignty

### Four pillars of Sovereignty

1. Data Sovereignty

2. Provider Switchability: Freedom of choice between several providers and
   the ability to easily switch between them.

3. Technical Sovereignty: The ability to study technology, to shape it according
   to your needs, to innovate and to contribute.

4. Open Operations: The ability to acquire the knowledge and skills from
   documentation, knowledge sharing and learning events, transparency on
   operational processes in order to be capable to operate your own
   infrastrcuture.

### About Sovereign Cloud Stack
* The idea is to leverage mature Open Source Software (OSS) to support digital sovereignty
    - The challenge is to integrate them in a coherent and standardized way to create
      standards and a mature product that can be operated without too much scarce expert knowledge.
* This is done in several ways:
    1. By making it easier for local providers and allow self-hosting, data sovereignty is supported.
    2. By having many provider adhering to the same [technical standards](https://docs.scs.community/standards), switching providers becomes a lot easier. The standards are covered by [automated continuous tests](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/Tests/) and can be certified (*SCS-compatible*)
    3. By having an openly developed complete open source [reference implementation](https://docs.scs.community/docs/category/releases), everyone
       can adjust technnology and contribute to it, thus delivering on technical sovereignty (*SCS-open*)
    4. By giving transpareny into operations (e.g. via blog articles, OSHM, Lean Operator Coffee),
       some collaborative element is added to the Ops part of DevOps. [Open Operations](https://openoperations.org/) thus enables the highest level (*SCS-sovereign*).
* SCS was a project by the Open Source Business Alliance e.V. ([OSBA](https://osb-alliance.de/)) in Europe in the [Gaia-X](https://gaia-x.eu/) context and received public funding from German [BMWK](https://bmwk.bund.de/) 2021 -- 2024.
* It has collaboratively and openy developed and released 5 versions of *SCS-compatible* IaaS standards,
  1 version of KaaS standards, 8 releases of the reference implementation, has organized two own conferences (SCS summits), 4 Hackathons and has contributed to numerous publications and conferences.
* The standards evolution is now goverend by the [Forum SCS-Standards](https://sovereigncloudstack.org/)

## GovStack
* govstack <https://govstack.global/> is an international project to
    - [GovSpecs](https://www.govstack.global/our-offerings/govspecs/): Specify building blocks that support governments to provide digital services to their citizens, businesses, civil society, ...
    - [GovTest](https://www.govstack.global/our-offerings/govtest/): Tests for compliance with GovSpecs
    - [GovLearn](https://www.govstack.global/our-offerings/govlearn/): Learning opportunities around the GovSpec Building Blocks
    - [GovMarket](https://www.govstack.global/our-offerings/govmarket/): Implementations of these specifications
* A number of blocks have been specified, identity management, payment, etc., see <https://govstack.gitbook.io>
    - One of them is a cloud building block
* Govstack is supported by German [BMZ](https://www.bmz.de/en), [GIZ](https://giz.de/), [DIAL](https://dial.global/), [ITU](https://itu.int), [Estonia](https://vm.ee/en)

### SCS and govstack
* The SCS project has contributed to the govstack cloud building block,
  reflecting some high level principles behind the standardization.
* The SCS reference implementation fulfills the govstack Cloud BB's
  specifications and is thus listed on the GovMarket.
* The trainings are a contribution to spread the skills and this way support
  Digital Sovereignty. Thanks!

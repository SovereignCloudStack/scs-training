Contributions:
- A significant fraction of the material is based on documentation that
  has been created by the [SCS Community](https://scs.community/) during
  the SCS project. It also contains numerous links to the
  [SCS documentation](https://docs.scs.community/)
- Karsten Samaschke (CEO VanillaCore GmbH) has created the concept for the
  cloud fundamentals training that this advanced course builds upon.
- Christian Berendt (CEO OSISM GmbH) and his company is the main developer
  behind the [OSISM](https://osism.tech/) framework used to deploy and manage
  the current implementation
  of the SCS IaaS reference implementation and also a key contributor to the
  upstream OpenStack kolla-ansible approach. Christian has reviewed and
  improved this course.
- The materials for the SCS Cluster Stacks, for SCS monitoring and for the

The current CC-BY-SA-4.0 license is a (suitable) place holder until

## Usage
Making this material freely available has the downside that any company
can use it and offer trainings based on this material. A good training
can only be delivered by trainers that have deep knowledge and experience
in deploying and running SCS infrastructure. There is currently no formal
training certification program by the Forum SCS-Standards at the
[OSBA](https://osb-alliance.de/)
who owns and governs the SCS trademarks. When offering SCS trainings, we
recommend to reach out to the Forum SCS-Standards <scs@osb-alliance.com>
to ensure that this can be done. We recommend trainees to ensure that
trainings are offered in alignment with the licensing terms of the ITU
and the support from the Forum SCS-Standards at the OSBA.

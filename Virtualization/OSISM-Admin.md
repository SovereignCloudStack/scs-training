## OSISM manager tooling

### OpenStack Flavor-Manager

#### Purpose
* SCS prescribes a flavor naming scheme in standard [scs-0100](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0100-v3-flavor-naming)
    - Flavor names like `SCS-nV-m` denote a flavor with `n` vCPUs and `m` GiB of RAM, the `V` denotes that
      vCPUs might be oversubscribed (up to 5x, or 3x for a hyperthread), but they need to be secure
      (CPU speculation vulnerabilities mitigated), RAM must be ECC protected and not oversubscribed.
    - `SCS-nC-m-20s` would denote a flavor with `n` dedicated Cores (the `C`) and 20 GiB SSD/NVMe
      (the `s`) root disk.
    - Decoding can be done with a simple web tool <https://flavors.scs.community/>.
    - The scheme allows for many more details (such as hypervisor, cpu generation, GPU, ...) 
      to be specified via the name, but these are really only used for special requirements.
    - The scheme also prescribes metadata (`extra_specs`) for discoverability
    - Flavors that do not start with `SCS-` are allowed and don't need to comply
* There is also a set of mandatory flavors that need to be present on each cloud that
  wants to be *SCS-compatible* at the IaaS (virtualization) layer. It is specified in standard
  [scs-0103](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0103-v1-standard-flavors).
    - Note that there is a selection of 13 flavors with 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8 ratio of vCPU to RAM (in GiB),
      with up to 16 vCPUs and up to 32GiB of RAM. Larger flavors are of course allowed.
    - Two flavors `SCS-2V-4-20s` and `SCS-4V-16-100s` have a local SSD/NVMe included and are meant
      for etcd and database usage.
* The SCS compliance checks test for these.
- The SCS flavor manager allows to create these flavors

#### Usage
* On the manager node, run `osism manage flavors --help`
```bash
dragon@testbed-manager(test):~/.config/openstack [0]$ osism manage flavors --help
usage: osism manage flavors [-h] [--no-wait] [--cloud CLOUD] [--name {scs,osism,local,url}] [--url URL]
                            [--recommended]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --no-wait             Do not wait until flavor management has been completed
  --cloud CLOUD
                        Cloud name in clouds.yaml
  --name {scs,osism,local,url}
                        Name of flavor definitions
  --url URL     Overwrite the default URL where the flavor definitions are available
  --recommended         Also create recommended flavors
```

### Image Manager

#### Purpose
* Cloud providers must allow users to upload their own images (within fair use limits)
* For convenience, we recommend they offer public images that are centrally maintained
    - This saves work to customers by not having to upload standard vanilla upstream images
    - And it avoids the need to repeat this regularly to include the latest bug- and security fixes
    - Customization is then done via *user-data* injected at boot and typically consumed by `cloud-init`
* To make them really useful, users need to know what the policies of these images are
    - SCS has specified mandatory metadata (properties) for images in standard [scs-0102](https://docs.scs.community/standards/scs-0102-v1-image-metadata)
    - The metadata specifies technical settings (`architecture`, `os_version`, `min_disk`, `min_ram`),
      image handling policies (`replace_frequency`), image information (`image_source`, `image_build_date`,
      `image_original_user`), licensing information (only required for commercial OSes).
* The Image Manager helps the cloud operator to register compliant public images and to regularly
  provide updated versions of them.

#### Usage
* On the manager node, run
```bash
dragon@testbed-manager(test):~ [0]$ osism manage image --help
usage: osism manage image [-h] [--no-wait] [--dry-run] [--hide] [--delete] [--latest] [--cloud CLOUD]
                          [--filter FILTER] [--images IMAGES]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --no-wait             Do not wait until image management has been completed
  --dry-run             Do not perform any changes
  --hide                Hide images that should be deleted
  --delete              Delete images that should be deleted
  --latest              Only import the latest version for images of type multi
  --cloud CLOUD
                        Cloud name in clouds.yaml
  --filter FILTER
                        Filter images with a regex on their name
  --images IMAGES
                        Path to the directory containing all image files or path to single image file
```

* Image was converted to raw to allow for Copy-on-Write usage with ceph
    - This took a bit of time (4min30s) on ceph on the testbed's ceph

### Onboarding users

#### Workflow
* Create a domain
* Create first user in domain
    - For self-service capabilities (recommended): Assign domain-scoped manager role for domain
        * !NOTE! Never ever confuse `admin` privileges with `manager`. An `admin` owns your cloud.
* Create first project in domain, assign project-scoped `member` (+`load-balancer_member` + `creator`) roles
    - Optional convenience: Create first network with subnet, first router, connect to public network and subnet
    - Default security group (with egress and only internal traffic allowed) should nbe automatically there
* Recommendation: Automate these steps
    - Script
    - Workflow triggered from customer platform

<!--TODO Explaining domains, users, roles, ... here-->

### Assignments Manager

#### Image registration
- Add a Debian 12 image using the openstack image manager
- Add Ubuntu 24.04

#### User onboarding
- Perform the steps using the openstack CLI (optional: python SDK)
    * Domain creation
    * First user in Domain
        - Optional: Give domain-scoped manager privs to user
    * Create first project
    * Assign `member`, `load-balancer_member`, `creator` roles for project to user
    * Optional: Net, subnet, router settings
- Validate that the user can work
    * Assign a password, create clouds and secure.yaml and try to work as user
- Put this in a script, accepting two options to toggle domain-manager and default
  network/subnet/router creation
